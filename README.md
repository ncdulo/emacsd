# emacsd

My personal .emacs.d setup. This repository is intended to backup my emacs.d configuration directory while also maintaining a history of changes. The original base was created using [Emacs Bootstrap](http://www.emacs-bootstrap.com/)

* Automatic installation of required packages via use-package
* Org-mode setup built up around the GTD system
* Delicious zenburn
* Buffer tabs and tab groups
* QoL tweaks to basic editing/movement commands
