# emacsd
## Summary
My personal .emacs.d setup. This repository is intended to backup my emacs.d configuration directory while also maintaining a history of changes. The original base was created using [Emacs Bootstrap](http://www.emacs-bootstrap.com/)

## Project Goals
* Learn ELisp
* Build a modular emacs config
  * And keep it readable too!
* Get the perfect emacs *for me*
